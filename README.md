# MiSTer Extensions

Extensions and utilities to make your [MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki) even better.

All scripts listed can be installed by downloading the linked file, placing it in the `Scripts` folder of your SD card, and running it from the `Scripts` menu on your MiSTer. No scripts require a keyboard to use or any additional dependencies.

Make sure to read the linked documentation for each script you use. Most are simple and work out-of-the-box, but some require manual setup before they do anything useful.


## BGM
Play your own music in the MiSTer menu. BGM is a highly configurable background music player that automatically pauses when you're playing games. Supports many common audio formats including internet radio streams.
