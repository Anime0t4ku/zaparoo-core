# Custom Labels

## Generating Labels

Labels can be created in bulk using the [TapTo Designer](https://tapto-designer.netlify.app/) web app by [Andrea Bogazzi](https://github.com/asturur). This app allows you to drag in box art images, which will be automatically applied to templates and made available to export as PDF. The app is pre-filled with a set of templates by [Tim Wilsie](https://twitter.com/timwilsie).

## Printing and Cutting Labels

A photo printer from a reputable brand such as Epson, HP, or Brother is recommended for good quality color prints. For cutting the labels, an inexpensive paper corner rounder can be used for clean cuts on the rounded edges of the labels. Alternatively, a Cricut machine can be used to automate this process somewhat.
