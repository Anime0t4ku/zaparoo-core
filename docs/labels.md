# Custom Labels

## Generating Labels

Labels can be created in bulk using the [TapTo Designer](https://tapto-designer.netlify.app/) web app by [Andrea Bogazzi](https://github.com/asturur). This app allows you to drag in box art images, which will be automatically applied to templates and made available to export as PDF. The app is pre-filled with a set of templates by [Tim Wilsie](https://twitter.com/timwilsie).
